# Frontend - E-commerce Angular Application

This project is the front-end counterpart of a Java Spring Boot-based e-commerce back-end. The frontend runs on `http://localhost:4200/`, it communicates with the backend via RESTful HTTP endpoints and supports authentication, product browsing, shopping cart management, and user-specific operations.

## üîê Authentication & Security

- Uses **JWT tokens** for login/session management.
- Upon login, token is stored locally and attached automatically to requests via the `AuthInterceptor`.
- Angular route guards (`AuthGuard`) and role metadata restrict access to authorized users only.
- Unauthorized access is redirected to the `/forbidden` route.

## üñºÔ∏è Product Image Handling

- Each product may contain **multiple images**, which are:
  - **Stored in the PostgreSQL database** via the backend
  - **Base64-encoded** and sent to the frontend
- The `ImageProcessorComponent`:
  - Converts base64 images into `Blob` and `File` objects
  - Sanitizes URLs using `DomSanitizer`
  - Enables secure and dynamic image preview in the browser

---

## üé® UI & Design

- Built with **Angular Material** components:
  - Toolbar, Forms, Buttons, Icons, Dialogs, Tables, Snackbar, etc.
- Uses **Bootstrap** classes and grids for layout and responsiveness
- Designed for desktop usage with responsive adaptation

  `http://localhost:8080`
- Backend implemented in:
  - **Java 11** with **Spring Boot**
  - **PostgreSQL** database

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to 
## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
